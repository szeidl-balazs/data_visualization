# Data visualization

## Story

It can be quite hard to show all of your data with just your regular programming language, which is why
data visualization tools such as `D3.js` exist. There are many different ways to visualize data: with bars,
shapes etc. As being able to see the data can be very useful, you have decided to give data visualization
a shot.

## What are you going to learn?

- Visualizing data with D3.js

## Tasks

1. Choose from one of the data files in the `Background materials` section. Its data will be the data you will visualize.
    - Students have chosen a data file

2. Choose an example from the `D3 examples` or the `More D3 examples + tutorials`, and change it, so that your csv's data is shown in the example.
    - The data shown in the example is the chosen csv's data

3. Change the visualization in some way. For example, you could make the part where the mouse is change color, write out the data the mouse is on etc.
    - The visualization has been changed in some way

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- Each data file has slightly different kinds of data. It might be worthwhile to check each of them.
- It's important to be able to understand the data from the visualization. Try to choose an appropriate
example!
